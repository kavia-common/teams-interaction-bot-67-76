# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Compact Mode**: A compact theme with smaller typography and tighter spacing is enabled by default.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Compact Theme

The app uses token-driven CSS variables for sizes and spacing. Compact mode is ON by default.  
To disable compact mode (use more spacious sizing), set the environment variable:

- REACT_APP_COMPACT_MODE=off

You can also toggle compact mode at runtime using the "Compact" button in the top toolbar.

## Styling

- Ocean Professional palette is preserved in `src/theme.css`.
- Global tokens (font sizes, spacing, radii) are defined in `src/theme.css` and applied throughout.
- Common components (navbar, buttons, cards, inputs, table) consume the tokens via CSS variables.
