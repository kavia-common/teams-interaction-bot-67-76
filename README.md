## Backend Echo Bot Service

A Microsoft Bot Framework Echo Bot backend has been added under `teams-interaction-bot-67-76/backend_bot`.

- To run it locally, see the detailed README: `teams-interaction-bot-67-76/backend_bot/README.md`
- Default endpoint: `POST http://localhost:3978/api/messages`
- Health check: `GET http://localhost:3978/healthz`

This backend is independent of the React frontend and is intended for local testing with the Bot Framework Emulator.
